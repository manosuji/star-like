    <div class="text-block">
      I saw you /
      stranger across the parking lot of the grocery store /
      three-dollar soda in hand, /
      laughing to yourself, /
      the edges of it fraying like something well worn /
      I saw you from a distance /
      your features blotted out by the sun /
      the asphalt reflecting imagined tomorrows /
      into the edges of you /
      you throw me a glance and suddenly /
      here comes "love" at its most uncomplicated /
      reactions start happening in my stomach /
      I’m all put together out of order /
      a flustered sort of fluctuating /
      pop caps and pull tabs /
      the hiss of candid carbonation /
      this is all so laughably easy at a distance /
      the plot line fleshed out in so few seconds /
      I’m no longer hungry /
      love is always a house /
      but I’m airbnb-bumping my way /
      through door frames /
      stumbling on steps I do not see /
      the stairs always squeak / 
      and the new york times /
      sends me 36 more questions / 
      than I’m willing to ask /
      the distance is comfortable /
      there's a certain kind of /
      desire that comes with /
      not knowing its object /
      chest crushed in pepsi pop cola can /
      trying to swig, swallow a two-liter of belief / 
      til my stomach hurts from /
      chasing sensations that don’t belong to me /
      strung-out daydreams that fall out of place /
      as soon as I set them down /
      fantasies reused until they /
      form hands to hold in mine /
      I slip into sheets soft with the idea of you /
      listening to the chorus of empty breathing /
      it’ll all fade away much too soon /
      my heart feels like gum stretched thin /
      between callused fingers /
      pulled taut so the light hits /
      there’s something in me that deems /
      the unknown and the unknowable /
      holy /
      that only understands a love /
      sustained by discovery /
      I am scared of the knowing /
      of being split in two /
      wishbone and uncertainty /
      the marrow of me /
      the gushing out of /
      things I thought were mine /
      what happens if I am known /
      and discarded like /
      rotting fruit deemed unripe /
      when the time falls on uneven tunes /
      baptism turns shower /
      this is easier when I don't have /
      to get close to you /
      when our hands are not the same temperature /
      when the pot says to the potter: /
      you know nothing! /
      so I’ve closed all the windows /
      the shutters have slumped their shoulders /
      in white-flag despondency /
      the wind looks like it's had too much to drink /
      like it’s past tense becoming a future /
      and I hate the taste of my own mouth /
      I want to force-quit this one-act play /
      to stop playing chess with God /
      collapse with meaning into /
      a splendid resurrection of /
      all I have ever thought of wanting /
      glances catching /
      across the field, /
      on the other side of the escalator, /
      crossing the street /
      I want to know your name. /
      to see you /
      and say: /
      hello
