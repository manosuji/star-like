    <p>this site is a repository of poems I've written
        <br>in the past few years / and an exploration of shifting memory / 
        <br>in the context of a digital interpretation of blackout poetry. / 
        <br>when we write, how many thoughts do we lose / before we 
        <br>can articulate them? / thoughts are only present for a short time, 
        <br>then disappear / we can only exist in the space of the poem 
        <br>for so long / as it provides a shielded vulnerability / 
        <br>afterwards, we end up grasping 
        <br>for words, for memory / remembering things as they weren’t.</p>
